Finally, a simple base Emacs configuration framework

** Where to start
- Press ~C-c i~ to jump to ~/.emacs.d/spartan.el and edit your config

** How to keep up to date
Layers use pinned packages via Straight.el and are periodically updated.

- cd ~/.emacs.d

- M-x spartan-update-config-with-ediff

It is essential to ensure you have the latest configuration changes
merged from spartan-defaults.el, if there are any - to avoid breakage.
This is the userâ€™s responsibility at the end of the day.

In a worst case scenario, just rm ~/.emacs.d/spartan.el
(consider backing it up first, though) and allow the new
version to be regenerated on the next restart.

- git pull

- M-x straight-thaw-versions

- Restart Emacs
